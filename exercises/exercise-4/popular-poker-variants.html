        <h1>Explore Excting Poker Variants</h1>
        <p>
          While Texas Hold'em is the most popular poker variant, the world of
          poker offers a diverse range of games. Here are a few intriguing
          variants to consider:
        </p>
        <h3>1. Omaha Hold'em</h3>
        <p>
          Similar to Texas Hold'em, but players receive four hole cards, and
          they must use exactly two of them to form their hand.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Seven Card Stud</h3>
        <p>
          Players receive seven cards, and the goal is to form the best
          five-card hand. Betting rounds follow each card dealt.
        </p>
        <h3>3. Five Card Draw</h3>
        <p>
          Each player is dealt five private cards, and they can exchange some or
          all of them for new cards in an attempt to improve their hand.
        </p>
        <h3>4. Razz</h3>
        <p>
          A lowball variant where the goal is to have the lowest possible hand.
          Straights and flushes don't count, and Aces are low.
        </p>
        <h3>5. Pineapple and Crazy Pineapple</h3>
        <p>
          Variants of Hold'em where players receive three hole cards, but in
          Crazy Pineapple, one card must be discarded after the flop.
        </p>
        <h3>6. Stud High-Low</h3>
        <p>
          A split-pot variant of Seven Card Stud where the highest and lowest
          hands share the winnings.
        </p>
        <h3>
