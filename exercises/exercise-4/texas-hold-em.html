        <h1>How to Play Texas Hold'em</h1>
        <p>
          Texas Hold'em is the most widely played variant of poker and serves as
          an excellent starting point for new players. In this game, players
          receive two private cards (hole cards), and five community cards are
          placed face-up on the table. The objective is to form the best hand
          using any combination of these seven cards.
